title: Adrien Joly's ideas
---

## Done
- Idea: a shortcut to paste (⌘V) a URL directly as a Markdown link ✅
- A manifesto that startup owners would sign to promise that they would open-source their product whenever they decide to shut it down. ✅
- Web-based bittorrent client (URL to direct download) ✅
- A web-based remote control for whyd.com (when playing on another computer) ✅
- A chrome extension that links each contact to their corresponding contact details form on contacts.google.com ✅
- A way to group my incoming email based on my Google Contacts groups -> <a href="https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!category-topic/gmail/share-and-discuss-with-others/reading-and-receiving-messages/mac/google-chrome/GE-C9h1r_UA">productforums.google.com</a> ✅
- "Done list", a service that would congratulate you for all the tasks that you checked today, in your favorite todo-list app. ✅
- A service that agregates opinions about topics (e.g. Technologies), and allows comparing one with another. e.g. Emberjs vs Angularjs? ✅
- 1poll: a simple doodle alternative that would allow participants to add dates (and vote for them) in a textual format, in a vertical list instead of a table ✅
- "Copy That": An app that would convert a screenshot into a PDF with OCR'ed / copy-paste-able text. ✅
- <span class="hashtag">#music</span> "Upbeat50", a smart spotify 50-track playlist based on your favorite upbeat tracks. To sync for offline listening during commute to work. Would be updated every week or month. ✅
- <span class="hashtag">#productivity</span> "next step" for trello cards (chrome ext.): displays the next actionnable step under the title of each trello card ✅
